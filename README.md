### Hi there 👋

My name is Iris George! I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Alberta studying Ecolgoy, Evolution, and Environmental Biology. My GitHub is dedicated to some of the undergrad research I've done with the Change Lab at the UofA. 

- 🔭 I'm currently working on a comparison of different reef surveying techniques and their performance in relation to species and habitat traits.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning all kinds of coding basics and how to make my work nice and reproducible :) 
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on just about anything!
- 🤔 I'm looking for help with any mistakes you might spot in my work and various R code trouble-shooting.
- 💬 Ask me about my work or any questions you have about my repos.
- 📫 Contact me at: igeorge@ualberta.ca.
  - I can also be found on Research Gate @ Iris George.
  - Or on the [Change Lab webpage](https://greenlab.ca/about/).
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: fish are far superior to humans 🐠 > 👫
